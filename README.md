Welcome to PhantomPulse, a multi-threaded ghost hunting simulation implemented in C. This project simulates a communication network for ghost hunts, featuring dynamic and static memory allocation, linked lists, and threading techniques.

## Features

- **Dynamic Ghost Behavior**: Simulate ghost movements, evidence leaving, and interactions with hunters based on dynamic behaviors.

- **Multi-threaded Simulation**: Utilizes pthreads for parallel execution, creating separate threads for the ghost and individual hunters.

- **Detailed Logging**: Logs each action, including hunter movements, evidence collection, and ghost behaviors, providing insights into the simulation.
